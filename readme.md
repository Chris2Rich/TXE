# TODO
- finish implementing TCRS (with no trusted party)
- implement transaction verification (range proofs + UXTO)
- implement transaction builder (and mempool - db)
- implement transaction validation
- implement block verification 
- add p2p data transfer (i2p)
- add peer discovery (nodes connect to hardcoded seeds who themselves will record ip of every node)
- create gossip protocol for TX propagation (nodes randomly tell connected nodes part of mempool/new blocks)
- create CLI transaction builder
