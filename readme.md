# TODO
- finish ec_verify, allow for verification of points on a given curve for ecdsa verification to work properly.
- begin working on headers and mining algorithm !!!!! :D
- add lib/types for all types (keypair and signaturepair), prevents locality of types and allows for structs to be made simpler.
